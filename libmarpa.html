        <h2>About Libmarpa</h2>
	<p>
	Libmarpa is the C language library that implements the core of Marpa.
	It is part of Marpa::R2, a Perl CPAN module.
	For the moment,
	this entanglement makes sense --
	all of Libmarpa's tests are in Perl, and you really don't want
	to install Libmarpa without testing it
	on your configuration.
        <h2>Installing Libmarpa</h2>
	<p>Libmarpa's only requirements are Perl 5.10 and a C90 compiler.
	To install Libmarpa:
	<ul>
	<li><p>
	Download, install and test Marpa::R2.  Please do not skip the testing.
	<li><p>In the Marpa::R2 distribution file will be the file <code>Marpa-R2-N.NNNNNN/r2/libmarpa.tar</code>,
	where N.NNNNNN is your Marpa::R2 version number.
	Assuming that your Marpa::R2 distribution came as a tar file,
	that means the Libmarpa comes as a tar file inside a tar file.
	<li><p>
	The Libmarpa tar file is a product of the GNU autotools.
	I went to some trouble to keep it very "vanilla",
	so that it should have all the standard targets
	and install in all the usual ways.
	<li><p>
	The Libmarpa API document is online in
	<a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Marpa/libmarpa_api/cpan_indexed/index.html">
	HTML</a> and
	<a href="https://github.com/downloads/jeffreykegler/Marpa--R2/api-v2.14.0.pdf">
	PDF</a> form.
	Sources for the Libmarpa documentation are included
	in the Marpa::R2 distribution.
	</ul>
	<h3>The name of the tar file</h3>
	<p>
	Some may have noted, on reading my claim that
	<code>libmarpa.tar</code> is a very standard GNU
	distribution file,
	that it's name is not standard --
	it is not a compressed file,
	and it does not have the version number as part of its name.
	<code>libmarpa.tar</code> is not compressed because currently it is
	delivered inside another tar file, one which is almost always compressed.
	And the name is version-less for the convenience of the Perl build software.
	<p>
	The contents of <code>libmarpa.tar</code> are completely standard,
	so that if you want
	a more conventionally named distribution file,
	the shell command "<code>./configure; make dist</code>"
	will produce one.
