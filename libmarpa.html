        <h2>About Libmarpa</h2>
	<p>
	Libmarpa is the C language library that implements the core of Marpa.
	It is part of
	<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2">
	Marpa::R2</a>,
	a Perl CPAN module.
	For the moment,
	this entanglement makes sense --
	all of Libmarpa's tests are in Perl, and you really don't want
	to install Libmarpa without testing it
	on your configuration.
        <h2>Installing Libmarpa</h2>
	<p>Libmarpa's only requirements are Perl 5.10 and a C90 compiler.
	To install Libmarpa:
	<ul>
	<li><p>
	Download, install and test Marpa::R2.  Please do not skip the testing.
	<li><p>In the Marpa::R2 distribution file will be the file <code>Marpa-R2-N.NNNNNN/r2/libmarpa.tar</code>,
	where <tt>N.NNNNNN</tt> is the Marpa::R2 version number.
	Assuming that your Marpa::R2 distribution came as a tar file,
	that means the Libmarpa comes as a tar file inside a tar file.
	<li><p>
	The Libmarpa tar file is a product of the GNU autotools.
	I went to some trouble to keep it very "vanilla",
	so that it should have all the standard targets
	and install in all the usual ways.
	</ul>
	<h3>Documentation</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><p>
	The Libmarpa API document is online as
	<a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Marpa/libmarpa_api/cpan_indexed/index.html">
	HTML</a>.
	<li><p>
	PDF's of the Libmarpa API docs for the most recent versions
	can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jeffreykegler/Marpa--R2/downloads">
	Github's Marpa::R2 downloads page</a>.
	<li><p>
	Sources for the Libmarpa documentation are included
	in the Marpa::R2 distribution,
	in the file <code>Marpa-R2-N.NNNNNN/r2/libmarpa-doc.tar</code>,
	where <tt>N.NNNNNN</tt> is the Marpa::R2 version number.
	This documentation-only tar file is a product of the GNU autotools,
	and was intentionally kept very "vanilla".
	It should have all the standard targets and install in all the usual ways.
	</ul>
	<h3>More about the tar files</h3>
	<p>
	Some may have noted, on reading my claim that
	<code>libmarpa.tar</code> and <code>libmarpa-doc.tar</code>
	are very standard GNU
	autotools distribution files,
	that their names are not GNU autotools standard --
	they are not compressed files,
	and the version number is not part of the names.
	The tar files are not compressed because currently they are
	delivered inside another tar file, one which is almost always compressed.
	And the names are version-less for the convenience of the Perl build software.
	<p>
	The contents of
	<code>libmarpa.tar</code> and <code>libmarpa-doc.tar</code>
	are completely
	autotools standard,
	so that if you want
	a more conventionally named distribution file,
	the shell command "<code>./configure; make dist</code>"
	will produce one.
	<h2>Libmarpa and Perl</h2>
	<p>
	Libmarpa can run and even build on a system without Perl.
	It has no runtime, build-time or compile-time dependence on Perl.
	Testing, however, does require Perl and I strongly discourage
	running Libmarpa in a configuration on which it has not been
	tested.
	<h2>Libmarpa internals</h2>
	<p>
	The source files for Libmarpa come as part of the Marpa::R2 distribution,
	and can also be found in
	<a href="https://github.com/jeffreykegler/Marpa--R2">
	the Marpa::R2 github repository</a>.
	I worked hard to limit the prerequisites needed to
	configure, compile and run Libmarpa.
	Working on Libmarpa's internals is another matter.
	Libmarpa is literate programming --
	and work on Libmarpa's internals requires,
	among other things,
	Knuth's CWeb and therefore Tex.
	<p>
	Libmarpa is highly mathematical code,
	and its internals are, frankly, quite daunting.
	As an algorithm, Marpa has its moments of beauty,
	but nobody can say it achieves that beauty through simplicity.
	I once had hopes that Marpa would have the powerful,
	simple beauty of a late Picasso.
	But Angkor Wat and Hieronymous Bosch have their own beauty.
