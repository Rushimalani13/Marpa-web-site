	<h1>The Marpa Sixish interface</h1>
      </header>
      <section>
<h2>Why A Perl 6-ish interface?</h2>
<p>The Perl 6 regexes represents careful, detailed
and experienced thinking on representing
complex BNF grammars
to a modern programming audience.
The team behind it has an unsurpassed record
when it comes to language interfaces.
It makes sense for Marpa
to leverage their work.
<h2>About this document</h2>
<p>At the moment, these
are mainly notes to myself,
while I take the Sixish interface through its
early prototypes.
<h2>The first prototype</h2>
<p>
The first prototype will be limited, indeed.
It will 
compile exactly one Perl 6 grammar:
<code><pre>
'(' &lt;~~&gt;* ')'
</pre></code>
<p>
From this string, Sixish will produce
a recognizer which find match to this
grammar in strings of parentheses.
A journey of a thousand li begins with a single step.
<h2>Long term differences between Sixish and Perl 6</h2>
<p>
Marpa and LL differ heavily in their power,
abilities, and approach.
It does not make sense for
the Sixish interface to be either
a proper subset or superset of Perl 6.
Here are some of the areas that are likely to remain different
in the two.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Lookahead:
An LL-based parser like that behind Perl 6 really cannot function without
lookahead.
Marpa on the other hand,
does no lookahead.
It is O(n) for all LR-regular grammars without lookahead.
It may, however, be interesting to try to incorporate the Ruby
Slippers into the Sixish interface.
But most use of lookahead by Perl 6 is to get around limitations
that Marpa does not have.
<li>Backtracking:
The story here is similar to the one for lookahead.
Marpa does non-deterministic general BNF parsing without having to
backtrack.
Backtracking could be added to the Sixish interface,
but most use of backtracking by Perl 6 is to get around limitations
that Marpa does not have.
In the Marpa context,
backtracking is an expensive way to accomplish things
that can be done more easily.
<li>A PEG-style "pecking order":
A PEG style pecking order
will almost certainly never be implemented in the Sixish
interface.
Lookahead and backtracking are of limited use in
the Marpa context,
but there can be some applications for which they may be
convenient.
With PEG-style conflict resolution, on the other hand,
it becomes difficult to know exactly what the language is
that you are parsing.
(This is sometimes also a problem for backtracking.)
PEG-style disambiguation is a necessary evil in the LL context.
Marpa is a non-deterministic parser
and does not have conflicts to resolve,
so in the Marpa context, the PEG "pecking order" is an unnecessary evil.
