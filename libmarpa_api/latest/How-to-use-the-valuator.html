<h3 class="section">17.2 How to use the valuator</h3>

<p>Libmarpa's valuator provides the application with
&ldquo;steps&rdquo;, which are
instructions for stack manipulation. 
Libmarpa itself does not maintain a stack. 
This leaves the upper layer in total control of the
stack and the values which are placed on it.

   <p>As example may make this clearer. 
Suppose the evalution is at a place in the parse tree
where an addition is being performed. 
Libmarpa does not know that the operation
is an addition. 
It will tell the application that rule number <var>R</var>
is to be applied to the arguments at stack locations
<var>N</var> and <var>N</var>+1, and that the result is to placed in
stack location <var>N</var>.

   <p>In this system
the application keeps track of the semantics for all
rules, so it looks up rule <var>R</var> and determines that it
is an addition. 
The application can do this by using <var>R</var> as an index
into an array of callbacks, or by any other method
it chooses. 
Let's assume a callback implements the semantics
for rule <var>R</var>. 
Libmarpa has told the application that two arguments
are available for this operation, and that they are
at locations <var>N</var> and <var>N</var>+1 in the stack. 
They might be the numbers 42 and 711. 
So the callback is called with its two arguments,
and produces a return value, let's say, 753. 
Libmarpa has told the application that the result
belongs at location <var>N</var> in the stack,
so the application writes 753 to location <var>N</var>.

   <p>Since Libmarpa knows nothing about the semantics,
the operation for rule R could be string concatenation
instead of addition. 
Or, if it is addition, it could allow for its arguments
to be floating point or complex numbers. 
Since the application maintains the stack, it is up
to the application whether the stack contains integers,
strings, complex numbers, or polymorphic objects which are
capable of being any of these things and more.
