<h3 class="section">19.3 External error codes</h3>

<p>This section lists the external error codes. 
These are the only error codes that users
of the Libmarpa external interface should ever see. 
Internal error codes are in their own section. 
See <a href="Internal-error-codes.html#Internal-error-codes">Internal error codes</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: int <b>MARPA_ERR_NONE</b><var><a name="index-MARPA_005fERR_005fNONE-118"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>No error condition. 
The error code is initialized to this value. 
Methods which do not result in failure
sometimes reset the error code to <code>MARPA_ERR_NONE</code>. 
Numeric value: 0. 
Suggested message: "No error". 
</p></blockquote></div>

Numeric value: 6. 
Suggested message: "Separator has invalid symbol ID".

&mdash; Macro: int <b>MARPA_ERR_COUNTED_NULLABLE</b><var><a name="index-MARPA_005fERR_005fCOUNTED_005fNULLABLE-120"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A &ldquo;counted&rdquo; symbol was found
that is also a nullable symbol. 
A &ldquo;counted&rdquo; symbol is one that appears on the RHS
of a sequence rule. 
If a symbol is nullable,
counting its occurrences becomes difficult. 
Questions of definition and
problems of implementation arise. 
At a minimum, a sequence with counted nullables
would be wildly
ambigious.

        <p>Sequence rules are simply an optimized shorthand
for rules that can also be written in ordinary BNF. 
If the equivalent of a sequence of nullables is
really what your application needs,
nothing in Libmarpa prevents you from specifying
that sequence
with ordinary BNF rules.

        <p>Numeric value: 8. 
Suggested message: "Nullable symbol on RHS of a sequence rule".

is a duplicate of a BNF rule already in the grammar. 
Two BNF rules are considered duplicates if

          <ul>
<li>Both rules have the same left hand symbol, and
<li>Both rules have the same right hand symbols in the same order. 
</ul>

        <p>Duplication of sequence rules,
and duplication between BNF rules and sequence rules,
is dealt with by requiring that the LHS of a sequence rule
not be the LHS of any other rule.

        <p>Numeric value: 11. 
Suggested message: "Duplicate rule". 
</p></blockquote></div>

A token is a duplicate if one already read at the same

&mdash; Macro: int <b>MARPA_ERR_EIM_COUNT</b><var><a name="index-MARPA_005fERR_005fEIM_005fCOUNT-123"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This error code indicates that
an implementation-defined limit on the
number of Earley items per Earley set
was exceedeed. 
This limit is different from
the Earley item warning threshold,
an optional limit on the number
of Earley items in an Earley set,
which can be set by the application.

        <p>The implementation defined-limit is very large,
at least 500,000,000 earlemes. 
An application is unlikely ever to see this
error. 
Libmarpa's use of memory
would almost certainly exceed the implementation's
limits before it occurred. 
Numeric value: 13. 
Suggested message: "Maximum number of Earley items exceeded". 
</p></blockquote></div>

<blockquote><p>An non-negative event index was specified,
but there is no event at that index. 
Since the events are in sequence, this means it
was too large. 
Numeric value: 16.

<blockquote><p>The Libmarpa base grammar is in a "not ok"
state. 
Currently, the only way this can happen
is if Libmarpa memory is being overwritten. 
Numeric value: 29. 
Suggested message: "Marpa is in a not OK state".

rules. 
This is a recoverable error,
although most applications will want to treat
it as fatal. 
For more see the description of <a href="marpa_005fg_005fprecompute.html#marpa_005fg_005fprecompute">marpa_g_precompute</a>. 
Numeric value: 17.

<blockquote><p>This error code indicates that
indicates that
the token symbol is an inaccessible symbol &mdash; one which
cannot be reached from the start symbol.

        <p>Since the inaccessibility of a symbol is a property of the grammar,
this error code typically indicates an application error. 
Nevertheless, a retry at this location, using another token ID,
may succeed. 
At this writing,
the author knows of no uses of this technique.

        <p>Numeric value: 18. 
Suggested message: "Token symbol is inaccessible".

&mdash; Macro: int <b>MARPA_ERR_INVALID_LOCATION</b><var><a name="index-MARPA_005fERR_005fINVALID_005fLOCATION-130"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The location (Earley set ID) is not valid. 
It may be invalid for one of two reasons:
          <ul>
<li>It is negative,
and it is being used as the argument to a method
for which that negative value does not have a special meaning. 
<li>It is after the latest Earley set. 
</ul>

        <p>For users of input models other than the standard one,
the term &ldquo;location&rdquo;, as used in association
with this error code,
means Earley set ID or Earley set ordinal. 
In the standard input model, this will always
be identical with Libmarpa's other idea of
location, the earleme.

        <p>Numeric value: 25. 
Suggested message: "Location is not valid". 
</p></blockquote></div>

<blockquote><p>This error code indicates that
no tokens at all were expected at this earleme
location. 
This can only happen in alternative input models.

        <p>Typically, this indicates an application programming
error. 
Retrying input at this location will always fail. 
But if the application is able to leave this
earleme empty, a retry at a later location,
using this or another token,
may succeed. 
At this writing,

The limit on the length of a parse is implementation

        <p>This error code is unlikely in the standard input model. 
Almost certainly memory would be exceeded
before it could occur. 
If an application sees this error,
it almost certainly using one of the non-standard
input models.

        <p>Most often this messsage will occur because
of a request to add a single extremely long token,
perhaps as a result of an application error. 
But it is also possible this error condition will
occur after the input of a large number
