<h3 class="section">11.8 Precomputing the Grammar</h3>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: int <b>marpa_g_precompute</b> (<var>Marpa_Grammar g</var>)<var><a name="index-marpa_005fg_005fprecompute-43"></a></var><br>
<blockquote>
        <p><a name="marpa_005fg_005fprecompute"></a>Precomputation is necessary for a recognizer to be generated
from a grammar. 
On success, <code>marpa_g_precompute</code> returns a non-negative
number to indicate that it precomputed the grammar without
issues. 
On failure, <code>marpa_g_precompute</code> returns &minus;2.

        <p>Precomputation may return one or more events,
which may be queried using the
<code>marpa_g_event()</code> method. 
At this point events only occur when failure is reported,
and events always report issues. 
But application writers should expect future versions
to have events which are reported on success,
as well as events which do not represent issues.

        <p>A <code>MARPA_EVENT_LOOP_RULES</code> event occurs
when there are infinite loop rules (cycles)
in the grammar. 
The presence of one or more of these will cause failure
to be reported,
but will not prevent the grammar from being precomputed.

        <p>Each <code>MARPA_EVENT_COUNTED_NULLABLE</code> event is a symbol
which is a nullable on the right hand side of a sequence
rule &mdash; a &ldquo;counted&rdquo; symbol. 
The presence of one or more of these will cause failure
to be reported,
and will prevent the grammar from being precomputed. 
So that the programmer can fix several at once,
these failures are delayed until events are created
for all of the counted nullables.

        <p>Each <code>MARPA_EVENT_NULLING_TERMINAL</code> event is a nulling
symbol which is also flagged as a terminal. 
Since terminals cannot be of zero length, this is a logical
impossibility. 
The presence of one or more of these will cause failure
to be reported,
and will prevent the grammar from being precomputed. 
So that the programmer can fix several at once,
the failure is delayed until events are created
for all of the counted nullables.

        <p>Precomputation involves freezing
and then thoroughly checking the grammar. 
Among the reasons for precomputation to fail
are the following:

          <ul>
<li><code>MARPA_ERR_NO_RULES</code>: The grammar has no rules. 
<li><code>MARPA_ERR_NO_START_SYMBOL</code>: No start symbol was specified. 
<li><code>MARPA_ERR_INVALID_START_SYMBOL</code>: A start symbol ID was specified, but it
is not the ID of a valid symbol. 
<li><code>MARPA_ERR_START_NOT_LHS</code>: The start symbol is not on the LHS of any rule. 
<li><code>MARPA_ERR_UNPRODUCTIVE_START</code>: The start symbol is not productive. 
<li><code>MARPA_ERR_COUNTED_NULLABLE</code>: A symbol on the RHS of a sequence rule is
nullable. 
Libmarpa does not allow this. 
<li><code>MARPA_ERR_NULLING_TERMINAL</code>: A terminal is also a nulling symbol. 
Libmarpa does not allow this. 
</ul>

        <p>More details of these can be found under the
description of the appropriate code. 
See <a href="External-error-codes.html#External-error-codes">External error codes</a>.

        <p><code>marpa_g_precompute()</code> is unusual in that it
is possible to treat one of its failures as &ldquo;advisory&rdquo;,
and to proceed with parsing. 
If
<code>marpa_g_precompute()</code> fails with an error code
of <code>MARPA_ERR_GRAMMAR_HAS_CYCLE</code>,
parsing can proceed, just as it typically would for
success. 
The grammar will have been precomputed, as
calling the <code>marpa_g_is_precomputed()</code> method
will confirm.

        <p>Most applications, however,
will want to simply treat failure
with <code>MARPA_ERR_GRAMMAR_HAS_CYCLE</code>,
as simply another failure,
and fix the cycles before parsing. 
Cycles make a grammar infinitely ambiguous,
and are considered useless in current
practice. 
Cycles make processing the grammar less
efficient, sometimes considerably so. 
Detection of cycles is returned as failure
because that is by far the convenient thing to do
for the vast majority of applications.

        <p>Return value: On success, a non-negative number. 
On failure, &minus;2.

<blockquote><p>This function allows the application to determine if grammar
<var>g</var> has a cycle. 
As mentioned, most applications will want to treat these
as fatal errors. 
To determine which rules are in the cycle,
<code>marpa_g_rule_is_loop()</code> can be used.

        <p>Return value: On success, 1 if the grammar has a cycle,
0 otherwise. 
On failure, &minus;2.
