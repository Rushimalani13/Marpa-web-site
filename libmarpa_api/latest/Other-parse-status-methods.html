<blockquote>
        <p>Allows the user to deactivate and reactivate symbol completion
events in the recognizer. 
If <var>reactivate</var> is zero, the event is deactivated. 
If <var>reactivate</var> is one, the event is activated.

        <p>Symbol completion events are active by default if
the symbol was set up for completion events in the
grammar. 
If a symbol was not set up for completion events in
the grammar, symbol completion events are inactive
by default and any attempt to change that is a fatal error.

        <p>Success cases:
On success,
the method returns the value of <var>reactivate</var>. 
The method succeeds trivially
if the symbol is already set as indicated by
<var>reactivate</var>.

        <p>Failure cases:
If the active status
of the
completion event for <var>sym_id</var>
cannot be set as indicated by <var>reactivate</var>,
the method fails. 
On failure, &minus;2 is returned. 
</p></blockquote></div>

&mdash; Function: int <b>marpa_r_earley_item_warning_threshold_set</b> (<var>Marpa_Recognizer r, int threshold</var>)<var><a name="index-marpa_005fr_005fearley_005fitem_005fwarning_005fthreshold_005fset-71"></a></var><br>

<blockquote>
        <p>These methods, respectively, set and query
the Earley item warning threshold. 
The <dfn>Earley item warning threshold</dfn>
is a number that is compared with
the count of Earley items in each Earley set. 
When it is matched or exceeded,
a <code>MARPA_EVENT_EARLEY_ITEM_THRESHOLD</code> event is created.

        <p>If <var>threshold</var> is zero or less,
an unlimited number of Earley items
will be allowed without warning. 
This will rarely be what the user wants.

        <p>By default, Libmarpa calculates a value based on the grammar. 
The formula Libmarpa uses is the result of some experience,
and most applications will
be happy with it.

        <p>Return value:
The value that the Earley item warning threshold has
after the method call is finished. 
Always succeeds.

<blockquote><p>Sets the &ldquo;expected symbol event bit&rdquo; for <var>symbol_id</var> to <var>value</var>. 
A recognizer event is created whenever
symbol <var>symbol_id</var> is expected at the current earleme. 
if and only if the expected symbol event bit
for <var>symbol_id</var> is 1. 
The &ldquo;expected symbol event bit&rdquo; must be 1 or 0.

        <p>In this context, &ldquo;expected&rdquo; means &ldquo;expected as a terminal&rdquo;. 
Even if a symbol is predicted at the current earleme,
if it is not acceptable as a terminal,
it does not trigger an
&ldquo;expected symbol event&rdquo;.

        <p>By default, the &ldquo;expected symbol event bit&rdquo; is 0. 
It is an error to attempt to set the
&ldquo;expected symbol event bit&rdquo; to 1 for a nulling symbol,
an inaccessible symbol,
or an unproductive symbol.

        <p>Return value:
The value of the event bit after the method call is finished. 
-2 if <var>symbol_id</var> is not the ID of a valid symbol;
if it is the ID of an nulling, inaccessible for unproductive symbol;
or on other failure.

<blockquote><p>A parser is &ldquo;exhausted&rdquo; if it cannot accept any more input. 
Both successful and failed parses can be exhausted. 
In many grammars,
the parse is always exhausted as soon as it succeeds. 
Good parses may also exist at earlemes prior to the
current one.

        <p>Return value:
1 if the parser is exhausted, 0 otherwise. 
Always succeeds.

        <p>Symbol nulled events are active by default if

If a symbol was not set up for nulled events in
the grammar, symbol nulled events are inactive
