<h4 class="subsection">4.1.5 The standard model of input</h4>

<p>In the standard model of input,
calls to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>
and <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code> are
made in pairs. 
There is, first, exactly one call
to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>,
and it is for a token with length 1. 
Following it must be a call
to <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>. 
For an input of length <var>n</var>, there will be
exactly <var>n</var> such paired calls.

   <p>Suppose, in the standard model that,
for a call
to <code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>,
the following is true:
     <ul>
<li>The current earleme before the call was <var>c</var>. 
</ul>
   Because this is the standard model,
this means that we also know that
     <ul>
<li>The latest earleme before the call was <var>c</var>. 
<li>The furthest earleme before the call was <var>c</var>. 
</ul>
   In that case,
after the call to
<code>marpa_r_alternative()</code>,
the following will be true:
     <ul>
<li>The current earleme will still be <var>c</var>. 
<li>The latest earleme will still be <var>c</var>. 
<li>The furthest earleme will be <var>c</var>+1. 
</ul>

   <p>Suppose, in the standard model that,
for a call
to <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>,
the following is true:
     <ul>
<li>The current earleme before the call is <var>c</var>. 
</ul>
   Because this is the standard model,
this means that we also know that
     <ul>
<li>The latest earleme before the call was <var>c</var>. 
<li>The furthest earleme before the call was <var>c+1</var>. 
</ul>
   In that case,
after the call
to <code>marpa_r_earleme_complete()</code>,
the current, latest and furthest earlemes will
be the same. 
Specifically,
the following will be true:
     <ul>
<li>The current earleme will be advanced to <var>c+1</var>. 
<li>The latest earleme will be advanced to <var>c+1</var>. 
<li>The furthest earleme will remain at <var>c+1</var>. 
</ul>
