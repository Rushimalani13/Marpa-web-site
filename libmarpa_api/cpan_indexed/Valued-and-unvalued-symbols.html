<h3 class="section">5.2 Valued and unvalued symbols</h3>

<p>Libmarpa symbols can have values,
which is the traditional way of doing semantics. 
Libmarpa also allows symbols to be unvalued. 
An <dfn>unvalued</dfn> symbol is one whose value
is unpredictable from instance to instance. 
If a symbol is unvalued, we sometimes say that it
has &ldquo;whatever&rdquo; semantics.

   <p>Situations where the semantics can tolerate unvalued symbols
are surprisingly frequent. 
For example, the top-level of many languages is a series
of major units, all of whose semantics are typically accomplished
via side effects. 
The compiler is typically indifferent to the actual value produced
by these major units, and tracking them is a waste of time. 
Similarly, the value of the separators in a list is typically
ignored.

   <p>Rules are unvalued if and only if their LHS symbols
are unvalued. 
When rules and symbols are unvalued,
Libmarpa optimizes their evaluation.

   <p>It is in principle unsafe to check the value
of a symbol if it can be unvalued. 
For this reason,
once a symbol has been treated as valued,
Libmarpa marks it as valued. 
Similarly,
once a symbol has been treated as unvalued,
Libmarpa marks it as unvalued. 
Once marked, a symbol's valued status is
<dfn>locked</dfn> and cannot be changed later.

   <p>The valued status of terminals is marked the first
time they are read. 
The valued status of LHS symbols must be explicitly
marked by the application when initializing the
valuator &mdash; this is Libmarpa's equivalent of
registering a callback.

   <p>LHS terminals are disabled by default. 
If allowed, the user should be aware that the valued
status of a LHS terminal
will be locked in the recognizer
if it is used as a terminal,
and the symbol's use as a rule LHS
in the valuator must be
consistent with the recognizer's marking.

   <p>Marpa reports an error when a symbol's use
conflicts with its locked valued status. 
Doing so usually saves the programmer
some tricky debugging further down the road. 
But it is possible that an application might deliberately
want to mix
valued and unvalued uses of a symbol &mdash; an application
might be able to differentiate them using the larger
context, or might be tolerant of the uncertainty. 
If there is interest,
a future Libmarpa extension might allow a locked
valued status to be overriden.
