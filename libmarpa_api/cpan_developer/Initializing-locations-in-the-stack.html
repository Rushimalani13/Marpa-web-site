<h4 class="subsection">17.4.2 Initializing locations in the stack</h4>

<p>Write optimizations also creates issues for implementations
which require data to be initialized before reading. 
Every fully standard-conforming C application is such an
implementation. 
Both C90 and C99 allow &ldquo;trap values&rdquo;,
and therefore conforming applications must be
prepared for
an uninitialized location to contain one of those. 
Reading a trap value may cause an abend. 
(It is safe, in standard-conforming C, to write to a location
containing a trap value.)

   <p>The requirement that locations be initialized before
reading occurs in other implementations. 
Uninitialized locations will correspond to unvalued symbols,
but an implementation may require even &ldquo;unvalued&rdquo; symbols to have
a value that belongs to its &ldquo;universe&rdquo; of values. 
A symbol is
&ldquo;unvalued&rdquo; if it does not have a predictable <strong>specific</strong> value. 
For example, an application may be implemented
expecting every item on the stack
to belong to a class,
in which case
the set of all objects of that class would
be that application's
&ldquo;universe&rdquo; of values. 
In such an implementation,
just as in standard-conformant C, every stack location
would need to be initialized before being read.

   <p>Due to write optimizations, an application
cannot rely on Libmarpa's step instructions to
initialize every stack location before its first read. 
One way to safely deal with the
initialization of stack locations,
is to do all of the following:
     <ul>
<li>When starting evaluation, ensure that the stack contains at least location 0. 
<li>Also, when starting evaluation, initialize every location in the stack. 
<li>Whenever the stack is extended,
initialize every stack location added. 
</ul>

   <p>Applications which try to optimize out some of
these initializations
need to be aware that
an application can never assume that activity in
the stack is safely &ldquo;beyond&rdquo; an uninitialized location. 
Libmarpa steps often revisit earlier sections of the stack,
and these revisits may include reads of previously
unvisited stack locations.
