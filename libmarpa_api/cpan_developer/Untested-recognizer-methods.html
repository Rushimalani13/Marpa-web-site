<blockquote>
        <p>Allows the user to deactivate and reactivate symbol completion
events in the recognizer. 
If <var>reactivate</var> is zero, the event is deactivated. 
If <var>reactivate</var> is one, the event is activated.

        <p>Symbol completion events are active by default if
the symbol was set up for completion events in the
grammar. 
If a symbol was not set up for completion events in
the grammar, symbol completion events are inactive
by default and any attempt to change that is a fatal error.

        <p>Success cases:
On success,
the method returns the value of <var>reactivate</var>. 
The method succeeds trivially
if the symbol is already set as indicated by
<var>reactivate</var>.

        <p>Failure cases:
If the active status
of the
completion event for <var>sym_id</var>
cannot be set as indicated by <var>reactivate</var>,
the method fails. 
On failure, &minus;2 is returned.
